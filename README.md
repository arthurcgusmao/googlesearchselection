# googlesearchselection script

This is an extremely simple shell script that opens a new google search tab in
the default web browser for the current selected text (in any program). You can
then link the command to a keyboard shortcut of your choice.

The idea came from 
[notitrans](http://www.webupd8.org/2016/03/translate-any-text-you-select-on-your.html).

This script requires *x-sel*, which can be installed via *apt-get*.

To use it, simply paste the script into */usr/local/bin/* folder.
